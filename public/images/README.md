# Mystery Photos Requirements

Place your mystery photos here with the following names:

- `mystery-photo-1.jpg` (First stage - AMOUR)
- `mystery-photo-2.jpg` (Second stage - BONHEUR)
- `mystery-photo-3.jpg` (Third stage - TOUJOURS)

Each photo should:

1. Be in JPG format
2. Have a 16:9 aspect ratio (recommended)
3. Be high quality but optimized for web (recommended size: 1920x1080px)
4. Be meaningful to the recipient (e.g., special memories or moments)

The photos will be progressively revealed as the player correctly guesses letters in each stage of the word game.

## Suggested Photo Selection

- Stage 1 (AMOUR): A romantic or meaningful couple photo
- Stage 2 (BONHEUR): A happy moment or celebration together
- Stage 3 (TOUJOURS): A photo representing your future together
